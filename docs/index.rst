Pelican
#######

Pelican is a simple weblog generator, written in python.

* Write your weblog entries directly with your editor of choice (vim!) and
  directly in restructured text, or markdown.
* A simple cli-tool to (re)generate the weblog.
* Easy to interface with DVCSes and web hooks
* Completely static output, so easy to host anywhere !

Features
========

Pelican currently supports:

* blog articles and simple pages
* comments, via an external service (disqus). Please notice that while
  it's useful, it's an external service, and you'll not manage the
  comments by yourself. It could potentially eat your data. (optional)
* easy theming (themes are done using `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org>`_)
* PDF generation of the articles/pages (optional).
* publication of articles in various languages
* RSS/Atom feeds
* wordpress/dotclear or RSS imports
* integration with various tools: twitter/google analytics (optional)
