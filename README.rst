Pelican is a simple weblog generator, written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_.

* Write your weblog entries directly with your editor of choice (vim!) 
  in `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ or `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_
* Includes a simple CLI tool to (re)generate the weblog
* Easy to interface with DVCSes and web hooks
* Completely static output is easy to host anywhere

Features
--------

Pelican currently supports:

* Blog articles and pages
* Comments, via an external service (Disqus). (Please note that while
  useful, Disqus is an external service, and thus the comment data will be
  somewhat outside of your control and potentially subject to data loss.)
* Theming support (themes are created using `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_)
* PDF generation of the articles/pages (optional)
* Publication of articles in multiple languages
* Atom/RSS feeds
* Code syntax highlighting
* Import from WordPress, Dotclear, or RSS feeds
* Integration with external tools: Twitter, Google Analytics, etc. (optional)

Why the name "Pelican"?
------------------------

Heh, you didn't notice? "Pelican" is an anagram for « Calepin » ;)
